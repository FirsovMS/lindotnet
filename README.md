lindotnet
=========

.Net wrapper library for [liblinphone](http://www.linphone.org/eng/documentation/dev/liblinphone-free-sip-voip-sdk.html) library. You can use it for simple interface for SIP telephony.
Most of the code was borrowed from [sipdotnet](https://github.com/bedefaced/sipdotnet) .net wrapper.
But in the process of work it became necessary to expand the functionality. What led to the creation of this project.

Current status: on development process.
