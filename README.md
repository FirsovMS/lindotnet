lindotnet
=========

.Net wrapper library for [liblinphone](http://www.linphone.org/eng/documentation/dev/liblinphone-free-sip-voip-sdk.html) library. You can use it for simple interface for SIP telephony.
Most of the code was borrowed from [sipdotnet](https://github.com/bedefaced/sipdotnet) .net wrapper.
But in the process of work it became necessary to expand the functionality. What led to the creation of this project.

On 10/26/2018 there is a beta release. The main functionality has been tested. Calls, messaging are performed.

### Important!
Do not try to use the latest "linphone-sdk-4.1.1"!
A problem with the audio output device has been noticed with it. 
Use the sdk supplied in the repository!

Current status: Testing. Development of functionality for video calls.
